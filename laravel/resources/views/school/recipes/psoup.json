    "p1": "Nigerian Pepper Soup is a one-pot dish that's defined by the nutty, bitter, woodsy, and floral notes imparted by a mix of spices and herbs.",
    "p2": "Pepper soup has a light, watery texture. The name is a misnomer because the soup is not necessarily defined by a pepper-forward flavor profile, that is, the flavors are much more complex, with nutty, bitter, woodsy, and floral notes, as well as warmth. It is considered to be a delicacy in West Africa, and is traditionally prepared with some medicinal herbs.",
