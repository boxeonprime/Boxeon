The main health benefits of eating Ata Dindin comes from its exotic blend of spices: African Curry
Powder. These are a few of the health benefits of this curry powder:


African Curry powder is a blend of spices like chilli powder, turmeric and coriander, ingredients
that have strong anti-inflammatory properties. In particular, turmeric has a pigment called curcumin
that's effective in combating inflammation.


All the spices in our African Curry Powder have excellent cancer-fighting properties. Curcumin,
for example, is an anti-cancer agent. It may help prevent prostate, breast and colon cancer.


African Curry powder contains ingredients rich in antioxidants that will prevent cell damage
caused by free radicals in your body. A high amount of free radicals can cause oxidative
stress. African Curry Powder will prevent this.
In addition to the health benefits derived from the curry powder, you can look forward to

We like to store ours in the pot that it was cooked in to avoid having more to wash.
Sometimes, we
turn the lid upside down to allow other items to be placed on top.
If you choose not to store your stew in the pot, try to avoid using a plastic container
since the
Palm Oil will make the plastic harder to clean.
