                "p": "Let's focus on the health benefits of Palm Oil (a major ingredient in this recipe) since this recipe focuses on low cholesterol:",
                "p1": "Palm oil is a rich source of a vitamin E derivative (tocotrienols) with strong antioxidant properties. Animal and human studies suggest that these compounds slow the progression of dementia or even prevent strokes from occurring.",
                "p2": "A study involving 121 people showed those who consumed palm oil for two years were less likely to experience lesion growth than those who did not receive treatment. Furthermore, palm oil and its derivatives can protect cognitive function in animals and cells.",
                "p3": "More than 50 studies concluded that people who consume diets rich in trans fat had higher total bad cholesterol levels than those who follow palm oil-rich diets.",
                "p4": "Palm oil  is credited with providing protection against heart disease - even though there were mixed study results, this oil has benefits for protecting one from heart-related risks. Some of these included lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and higher HDL (good) cholesterol levels.",
                "p5": "Red Palm Oil contains carotenoids which the body converts into Vitamin A, a necessary nutrient for healthy vision.",
                "p6": "People with Cystic Fibrosis, a condition which makes it difficult to absorb fat-soluble vitamins, experienced an increase in Vitamin A blood levels after taking two to three tablespoons of Red Palm Oil daily for 8 weeks."
