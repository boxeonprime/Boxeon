    "p1": "The first time I had fufu I felt robbed.  I would have grown up eating this amazing swallow, but for the Trans African Ocean Trade in Africans. My first bite into fufu was that powerful. I want you to experience this too.",
    "p2": "Fufu (or fufuo, foofoo, foufou) is a dough-like food found in West African cuisine. In addition to Ghana, it is also found in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, Cote D'Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, Angola and Gabon.",
   "p3":"It is often made in the traditional Ghanaian, Ivorian, Liberian, and Cuban method of separately mixing and pounding equal portions of boiled cassava with green plantain or cocoyam, or by mixing cassava/plantains or cocoyam flour with water and stirring it on a stove.",
   "p4":"A modern method of making fufu is to chop then blend the raw cassava and other ingredients then cook on a stove in water. The viscosity is then adjusted based on personal preference and eaten with broth-like soups. Some countries, particularly Nigeria, have a version of fufu made from fermented Cassava dough (called akpu by Nigerians) that is eaten with thick textured stews. Other flours, such as semolina, maize flour, or mashed plantains may take the place of cassava flour.",
   "p5":"Fufu is traditionally eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce.",
