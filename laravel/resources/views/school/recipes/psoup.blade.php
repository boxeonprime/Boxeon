Nigerian Okra Soup instructions

Cook beans until its just starting to become tender

Heat up a pot with Palm Oil

Once the above ingredients begin to give off their aromas, put in the chicken, maggi cubes,
smoked shrimp, stock water, chicken, and Afican Black Beans into the pot

We like to store ours in the pot that it was cooked in to avoid having more to wash. Sometimes, we
turn the lid upside down to allow other items to be placed on top.
If you choose not to store your stew in the pot, try to avoid using a plastic container since the
Palm Oil will make the plastic harder to clean.
