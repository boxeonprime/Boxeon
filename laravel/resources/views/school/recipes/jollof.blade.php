                <p>Jollof or Jollof Rice, is the most popular rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with
                    long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients
                    and preparation methods vary across different regions.</p>
                <p>Jollof originates from the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th
                    century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish
                    has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and
                    vegetables.</p>
                <p>Jollof Rice traditionally consists of rice, cooking oil, vegetables such as tomato, onion, red pepper,
                    garlic, ginger and scotch bonnet chilli peppers. To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (pur√©e)
                    is added. As seasoning, spices, salt, stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and
                    herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used. To complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish are
                    often served with the dish.</p>
                <p>Each West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,
                    Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof. This is
                    especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed the "Jollof Wars".</p>
