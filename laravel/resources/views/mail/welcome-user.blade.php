# <h2>Welcome to {{ config('app.name') }}!</h2>



 <p>Welcome to the Home In A Box Movement. You have successfully created a Boxeon account. We're glad to have you!</p>
 <p>Please reach out to us if you have any concerns.</p>

 <h2>About Boxeon</h2>

 <p>We started Boxeon to make it simple for the diaspora to enjoy the
foods they love from home. But we quickly learned that Boxeon is much more than that. </p>

<p>If you've ever had problems with time management and stress; if you've ever worried about 
the rampant carcinogenics in Western foods; if you've ever wished to experience more of 
your home culture; we're here for you.</p>
<p>We're here for anyone and everyone who wants to consume from back home but
whose time is valuable.</p>

<p>We're a service for diasporans with busy lives to automate and repatriate their grocery shopping.
We believe that a culture of "work abroad, but consume from home" will 
one day spark industrial revolutions in our home countries. That's what Boxeon is about.</p>


Thank you,<br>
