    "p1": "Jollof Rice is so good it survived the brutality of the Trans African Ocean Trade in Africans to become popular in the Caribbean. Being from Grenada, I've been eating it since I was a child. It is a testament to the fact that while others perished, we not only survived but refused to relinguish our culture.",
    "p2": "Jollof Rice is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.",
    "p3": "Jollof originates from the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice is grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.",
   "p4":"Each West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed the 'Jollof Wars'.",
