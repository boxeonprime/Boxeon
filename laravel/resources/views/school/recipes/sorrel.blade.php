Serving and storage instructions

We like to store ours in the pot that it was cooked in to avoid having more to wash. Sometimes, we
turn the lid upside down to allow other items to be placed on top.
If you choose not to store your stew in the pot, try to avoid using a plastic container since the
Palm Oil will make the plastic harder to clean.
