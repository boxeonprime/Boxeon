                <p>We started Boxeon to make it simple for New York City restaurant employees to cook a quick healthy dinner at home. But we
                    quickly learned that Boxeon is much more than that. If you've ever had problems with time
                    management and stress; if you've ever worried about your food budget; if
                    you've ever wished to experience more cultures; we're here for you.</p>
                <p>We're here for anyone and everyone who enjoy cooking the kinda meals they can pig out on.</p>
                <p> We're a service to help everyone with busy lives ditch grocery shopping and cook a fresh
                    NYC-style dinner in 15 minutes.</p>

                    <p>We want you to experience flavors that will touch your soul. That's what Boxeon is about.</p>
